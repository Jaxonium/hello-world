# hello-world

Hello

I'm Jaxonium, or Jaxon. At the time of writing, I'm a 16 year old Junior in High School.
I figured it was about time I looked into a career and programming caught my eye.
And so here I am, following the hello-world tutorial.

This is just me learning how to create a repository.
